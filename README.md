Diabetes Prediction using ANN with PyTorch
Project Overview

This repository contains Python code for predicting diabetes using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented with PyTorch. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

Dataset:

Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
Libraries:

PyTorch
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Model Architecture:

A feed-forward neural network with [specify number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, etc.]
Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
Optimizer: Adam
Steps Involved:

Import necessary libraries.
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Create the neural network model architecture.
Train the model using the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
